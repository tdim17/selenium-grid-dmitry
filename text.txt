This project about CI/CD automation flow. To see how it works in reality.
I can make some changes here and see result which is going throw the flow:
GITHub takes changes > GHub trigger the Jenkins by Hook trigger > Jenkins is coming in his role


That line is added just to push changes to GitHub to check out of the repository trigger to Jenkins Job
double attempt
I forgot to build trigger "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"

Rename branch main to master

Rename repository 2
